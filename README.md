# Faceoff

Faceoff is a game of emotions. Each player submits a photo of a person's face. Their photos are then evaluated by the Face++ API, an application that analyzes faces and outputs several data points, including human emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, etc.). The players agree on an emotion to analyze, and whichever photo Face++ determines to hold a higher percentage of wins.
